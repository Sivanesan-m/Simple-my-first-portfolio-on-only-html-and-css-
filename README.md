# Simple-my-first-portfolio-on-only-html-and-css-
A clean and minimal HTML portfolio built entirely from scratch without using templates or external references. Showcasing my own design approach and coding style, this project highlights my skills in HTML, CSS, and basic interactivity, serving as a personal space to present my work and profile online.
